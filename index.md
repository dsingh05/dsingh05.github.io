Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Diya Singh, and I'm currently a university student majoring in Cybersecurity Management and Analytics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). I’m passionate about cybersecurity, and this platform serves as a space for me to share my insights and experiences in the field.

On this site, I’ll be posting a variety of blogs focused on all things cybersecurity—ranging from the latest trends and technologies to personal reflections on the industry. I hope you find these posts both informative and thought-provoking! I also hope to be posting information about various projects and experiences I have in the field. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or through any of my other social channels. Additionally, I regularly publish blogs on my Medium page, so feel free to check that out as well! 

Thanks for visiting my page, and I look forward to sharing my cybersecurity journey with you!
