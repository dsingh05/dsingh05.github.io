The CompTIA Security+ is a well-known entry-level certification that many cybersecurity enthusiasts and job-seekers aim to achieve. That said, it can be a pretty daunting exam — especially if you’re coming in with minimal experience or no background in cybersecurity, like I was.
To break into the cybersecurity field, I set a goal for myself: pass the CompTIA Security+ exam. At first, it felt impossible. I had no idea where to start, was on a college-student budget, and had very little knowledge of cybersecurity concepts — but after a lot of hard work and trial and error, I came up with a foolproof plan that helped me pass the exam with a score of 783.
A goal that once felt out of reach ended up being totally doable, and I want to show you how you can do it too!

In this blog, I present a 5-step plan that you can follow at your own pace to successfully pass the exam. Personally, I spent about two months preparing with this approach, but remember, this guide isn’t just about passing the exam or earning a credential — it’s also designed to help you thoroughly understand the material so that you can apply the concepts on the job and in the real world.

The 5-step plan is a continuous process as follows:
1. Learn the exam outline and objectives
2. Study the essential concepts
3. Review the concepts
4. Practice, practice, and more practice
5. Repeat the process

Step 1: Learn the Exam Outline and Objectives
Learning the exam outline and objectives is a foundational part of studying for the Security+ exam. It sets the stage for what you should focus on and gives you a clear understanding of what the exam covers and its overall purpose. By reviewing these details, you’ll gain a solid idea of the topics included on the exam, which helps you narrow down the concepts and materials you need to study. I recommend visiting the CompTIA website to download a copy of the exam objectives. The exam objective effectively outlines key information about the exam, including the specific topics and domains you need to know.

Step 2: Study the Essential Concepts
Once you have a solid understanding of the concepts that will be tested on the exam, it’s important to start learning them in depth. I spent about a month studying the essential topics. Figuring out which learning style works best for you — whether that’s reading, listening, watching, or a mix — can make a big difference during this step. It helps you retain information more effectively and makes the process more efficient. Personally, I used a combination of reading and watching videos. One resource that really helped me was CompTIA’s CertMaster Learn. It provided a variety of learning formats and presented the material in an organized manner. I highly recommend the CertMaster bundles if they fit your budget — but they’re not essential. There are plenty of free resources out there too, like downloadable PDFs covering Security+ topics and Professor Messer’s free videos. I used these as well, and they were extremely helpful for learning the exam objectives and key concepts. I also strongly recommend taking detailed notes as you study. They’ll be incredibly useful when it comes time to review, which is the next step.

Step 3: Review Concepts
This step is essential for passing the exam. Not only is it important to study and understand the concepts that will be tested, but it is also extremely important to revise what you have learned. Regular review helps you stay on track and keep up with the wide range of topics covered on the exam. Some ways that I practiced reviewing concepts included reviewing my notes, creating flashcards, making my own study guides (let me know if you’d like access to them), and explaining concepts aloud to myself as if I were teaching them to someone else.

Step 4: Practice, Practice, & More Practice!
Practice makes perfect. It’s crucial to get the right practice when studying for the Security+ exam, as it helps not only with applying your knowledge but also with preparing for the real exam and identifying weak spots. Taking practice exams will give you a good sense of where you stand and allow you to make adjustments accordingly.
As a student on a budget, I prioritized finding free practice tests and questions through YouTube videos and channels. However, I also spent some money on CertMaster, which included practice questions and a mock exam at the end. Although CertMaster was helpful, it’s not necessary to buy. Cheaper practice tests are available on platforms like Udemy. As I got closer to the exam, I spent money on Professor Messer’s practice exams, which can be found on his the Professor Messer website. I’ve also heard good things about Dion Training’s practice exams, although they’re a bit pricier. Regardless of where you get your practice tests, just remember: practice is key.

Step 5: Repeat the Process
Once you’ve completed several practice questions, you’ll be able to identify your weak spots. After pinpointing these areas, you can repeat the five-step process, focusing more on what you missed or find challenging. For example, I struggled with understanding encryption methods, so I went back to study the essential concepts, watched videos on the topic, took notes, reviewed them, and then practiced with questions to see how much I had improved.

Bonus Tips:
All in all, this five-step plan is a solid way to study and retain everything you need to know for the exam. However, I’ve got a couple of bonus tips that might help you even more:

Bonus Tip #1: Get Hands-On Experience for Performance-Based Questions
One thing I wish I had done more of was getting hands-on experience. I personally struggled with the performance-based questions during my exam, mostly because I didn’t have a lot of real-world practice applying what I had learned. If you can, I highly recommend setting aside some time to explore and practice the cybersecurity concepts and domains covered in this exam in a hands-on way. It’ll really help you when those performance-based questions pop up.
I was still able to pass the exam fine, even though I was a bit sloppy on the performance-based questions, but if you want a higher score or wish to feel more confident, I’d definitely suggest practicing for those.

Bonus Tip #2: Memorize the Acronyms
Acronyms play a huge role in the Security+ exam and are in almost every question. Therefore, it is super important to memorize and understand the acronyms that you could encounter on the exam. I used the acronyms listed in the exam objectives PDF and made flashcards to help myself memorize them.

Conclusion:
I really hope this guide is helpful for you. Remember to take a deep breath and try not to stress out too much during your study process. If you follow this plan and dedicate at least a solid month to studying, you’ll be more than ready for the Security+ exam.

Good luck with your studies, and feel free to leave a comment or reach out if you have any questions!
